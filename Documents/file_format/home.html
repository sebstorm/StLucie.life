                <p>JPG is the file format that is used the most. It is very popular with photographers and web designers.  This is popular because of the compressive ability of the file.  The issue is that JPGs are very lossy.  This lossy trait is very costly on the image quality side.  You have to decide what is more important; saving space or image quality.  Examples of when to use JPGs are email and memory cards.  Since space is a premium and quality may not matter as much.  It is important to note that the more times you compress a JPG the more you will degrade the image.  This is because overtime you compress the file it loses more resolution.</p><br>
                <p>TIF is a lossless file.  It is considered to be one of the better formats available.  TIF does not have any JPG traits so it will maintain its quality through multiple compressions.  However, this file format cannot be read on web pages.  This is a severe drawback as more information is conveyed through the internet by way of web pages than any other medium.  This is a consideration for how you will choose an image file for your website.</p><br>
                <p>GIF is a very early file type. GIF is ok to use for small videos but does not retain resolution for printing.  GIF is considered good for web videos that do not require many color variations as this file is limited.</p><br>
                <p>PNG is replacing GIF for non animated images and also has some properties of the TIF.  The PNG is extremely versatile and is becoming very popular among web developers.  Again, PNG is great in the lossless compression area.  PNG should be a very general goto format for graphics and images. </p><br>

                            <h2>GIF</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/GCejWAogKWyic/200.gif" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>GIF was developed by CompuServe to show images online. GIF uses indexed color, which is limited to a palette of only 256 colors. GIF was a great match for the old 8 bit 256 color video boards, but is inappropriate for today's 24 bit photo images.

GIF files do NOT store the image's scaled resolution ppi number, so scaling is necessary every time one is printed. This is of no importance for screen or web images. GIF file format was designed for CompuServe screens, and screens don't use ppi for any purpose. Our printers didn't print images in 1987, so it was useless information, and CompuServe simply didn't bother to store the printing resolution in GIF files.</p><br>

<p>GIF is still an excellent format for graphics, and this is its purpose today, especially on the web. Graphic images (like the image above) use few colors. A 16 color GIF is a very small file, much smaller, and more clear than any JPG, and ideal for graphics on the web.

Graphics generally use solid colors instead of graduated shades, which limits their color count drastically, which is ideal for GIF's indexed color. GIF uses lossless LZW compression for relatively small file size, as compared to uncompressed data. GIF files offer optimum compression (smallest files) for solid color graphics, because objects of one exact color compress very efficiently in LZW.</p><br> 

<p>GIF optionally offers transparent backgrounds, where one palette color is declared transparent, so that the background can show through it. The GIF File - Save As dialog box usually has an Option Button to specify which one GIF palette index color is to be transparent.

Interlacing is an option that quickly shows the entire image in low quality, and the quality sharpens as the file download completes. Good for web images, but it makes the file slightly larger.

                            <p> JPG is often used on digital camera memory cards, but RAW or TIF format may be offered too, to avoid it. The JPG file is wonderfully small, often compressed to perhaps only 1/10 of the size of the original data, which is a good thing when modems are involved. However, this fantastic compression efficiency comes with a high price. JPG uses lossy compression (lossy meaning "with losses to quality"). Lossy means that some image quality is lost when the JPG data is compressed and saved, and this quality can never be recovered.</p><br>

<p>JPG compression is not lossless. JPG compression is lossy. Lossy means "with losses" to image quality. JPG compression has very high efficiency (relatively tiny files) because it is intentionally designed to be lossy, designed to give very small files without the requirement for full recoverability. JPG modifies the image pixels to be more convenient for its compression method. When we open the file and expand the data to access it again, it is no longer the same data as before. This lost data is like lost purity or integrity. It can vary in degree, it can be fairly good, but it is always an unrecoverable corruption of the data. This makes JPG different from all the other usual file format choices. If your end state is critical, you need a really good reason to use JPG.</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="http://webdelprofesor.ula.ve/humanidades/raymond/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/multimedia-1-800x526.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>PNG is not the number one file format, but you will want to know about it. PNG is not so popular yet, but it's appeal is growing as people discover what it can do.

PNG was designed recently, with the experience advantage of knowing all that went before. The original purpose of PNG was to be a royalty-free GIF and LZW replacement. However PNG supports a large set of technical features, including superior lossless compression from LZ77. Compression in PNG is called the ZIP method, and is like the 'deflate" method in PKZIP.</p><br>

<p>PNG incorporates special preprocessing filters that can greatly improve the lossless compression efficiency, especially for typical gradient data found in 24 bit photographic images. This filter preprocessing causes PNG to be a little slower than other formats when reading or writing the file (but all types of compression require processing time).

Most other programs do store and use the correct scaled resolution value in PNG files. PNG stores resolution internally as pixels per meter, so when calculating back to pixels per inch, some programs may show excessive decimal digits.</p><br>

<p>PNG has additional unique features, like an Alpha channel for a variable transparency mask. PNG files may also contain an embedded Gamma value so the image brightness can be viewed properly on both Windows and Macintosh screens. These should be wonderful features, but in many cases these extra features are not implemented properly in many programs, and so these unique features must be ignored for web pages. However, this does not interfere with using the standard features, specifically for the effective and lossless compression.</p>

                            <p>A bit map defines a display space and the color for each pixel or "bit" in the display space. A Graphics Interchange Format and a JPEG are examples of graphic image file types that contain bit maps.

A bit map does not need to contain a bit of color-coded information for each pixel on every row. It only needs to contain information indicating a new color as the display scans along a row. Thus, an image with much solid color will tend to require a small bit map.</p><br>

<p>Because a bit map uses a fixed or raster graphics method of specifying an image, the image cannot be immediately rescaled by a user without losing definition. A vector graphics graphic image, however, is designed to be quickly rescaled. Typically, an image is created using vector graphics and then, when the artist is satisfied with the image, it is converted to (or saved as) a raster graphic file or bit map.</p>

                            <p>TIFF is a standard file format found in most paint, imaging, and desktop publishing programs and is a format native to the Microsoft Windows GUI. TIFF's extensible nature, allowing storage of multiple bitmap images of any pixel depth, makes it ideal for most image storage needs.

TIFF has earned a reputation for power and flexibility, but it is considered complicated as well. In its design, TIFF attempts to be very extensible and provide many features that a programmer might need in a file format. Because TIFF is so extensible and has many capabilities beyond all other image file formats, it is probably the most confusing format to use.

A common misconception about TIFF is that TIFF files are not very portable between software applications. This is amazing considering that TIFF is widely used as an image data interchange format. </p>

                            <p>EPS or Encapsulated PostScript is a standard graphics file format for exchanging images, drawings (such as a logo or map) or even layouts of complete pages. An EPS file internally contains a  description of such an object or layout using the PostScript page description language. It can include both bitmap and vector data.  The purpose of an EPS file is to be included in other pages. Sometimes EPS files are called EPSF files. EPSF simply stands for Encapsulated PostScript Format. EPS files have the extension .eps or .epsf.</p><br>

                            <p>An EPS file can contain any combination of text, graphics and images. Since it is actually a PostScript file, it is one of the most versatile file formats that are available. EPS-files usually contain a small preview image that is used to visualize the content of the file. This is done so that applications don’t need a PostScript interpreter to display the content of the EPS file. Even office applications such as Microsoft Word can display the preview image. If an EPS file is sent to a printer that doesn’t support PostScript, it is once again this preview image that is printed. The quality will not equal that of the read EPS artwork but at least there is an image on the print-out. There are millions of people working with *.eps files without realising how complex the artwork they are using really is.</p>
